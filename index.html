    <li>In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy
      implications of computing and information.</li>
